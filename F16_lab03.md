// James Yang and Arturo Milanas 


	a. We are creating a bot that will enable the user to input a set of desired classes, which the bot will automatically get for you from the ninjacourse database. This will allow users to take their time while building their schedules.
	
	b.
	- As a computer engineer at UCSB I can see that the current version of the GOLDER is a bit outdated. It relies on obtaining information from Ninjacourses, which itself is a bit outdated in terms of courses offered at the university
	- As a computer engineer I can see that this current program isn't very user friendly when it comes to simplifying class schedules.( It generates 10's of options that you manually look through each one).
	- As a computer engineer I can see there are various bugs that cause it to fail that we have to fix as well. 

	c. The software somewhat starts up and presents some graphics on the screen with a login screen. But that's all we could really test due to the bug that causes the screen to be blank. Yet if you were to check the code there is running code and it all compiles, so it does somewhat run, just there is a bug preventing us for testing more functions. 

	d.
	-I believe that we can add a couple of features that could make this more usable towards the student population as a whole.
	-The first would be the main task we were assigned, which is to change the data source we obtain the courses availible from, to a UCSB data server and not ninjacourses.
	-Another thing we can do is make this a real bot in that after selecting all your courses it can cycle through desired courses and times to give you the classes you want at your pass time.
	-We can also make this availible to all UCSB students utilizing their ucsbnetID, rather than registering manually through the application itself. 

	e. Information that could be added could be what benefits this code has in terms of functionality when compared to Ninjacourse, the database that this code is currently taking it's data from. The current READMe is a good summary of what the code does, but as stated above it's confusing as to what makes this code unique from Ninjacourses.

	f. Most of the descriptions are just the targetnames, but most of them do give you a general idea what each target is/does; the targetnames are pretty self-explanatory.However, for init and compile they both have the same description as "compile", causing some confusion as to the functionality of both targets. There doesn't really seemt o be old stuff that needs to be removed. 

	g. There are currently 6 current issues for the project. The biggest problem seems to be that the GUI doesn't load up the proper login widgets and any graphics at all. All it loads up is a blank screen. We need to update the scraper tool in order for it to update the outdated GOLD ninjacourse information, or more likely we can add a bit of code so that it can update everytime we load up the program. Another problem is that the code for the web scraper and the socket connections all written in python and not java, so we'll need to rewrite that language. The rest of the issues are just code files that need to be redistrubuted and made easier, and also to clean up some archaic code. Also we need to update the database connection from MySQL to MySQL DB. I believe there are enough issues for us to update and possibly do more with in this project.

	h. I haven't really seen anymore issues mostly due to the fact that the GUI won't let us really test anymore functions due to the blank screen error listed above.

	i.  Looking at the code, it seems that it is well organized with clear methods and what their purpose is. The class purpose is also clear which implies what methods are supposed to be implemented in there as well. Between classes, it makes sense that some methods need to call a method from another class and that the classes interact with each other. The code is easy to understand and readable. Quick summary of code, the Course file has both Course.java and Lecture.java which respectively they store all data retrieved from the database and includes all information that we could want to change if the user does change it. The GUI file has a class for CreateAccount to create an acount, ForgotUser to not have the issue that you can never log in if you forget your password, Golder the class that starts the program, Login to log in, MainPage is simply the main page after you log in, UserInfo stores the information from the user, and theLogo which shows the logo of the program. The Schedule class has  CourseConflict which give you errors if the user can't add a course, ScheduleGUI is to test a methode from the Scheduler class which takes care of adding and removing courses from a schedule. Finally, we have the connection file that has a courseInfo file which contains the CourseConnection class that simply connects golder to courses, the connection file also has the UserInfo file that has both User class and UsersConnectio class which represents the user and connects to the database for user information respectively. And Finally, the connection file has one last class, GolderConnection, that holds the configuration information for a particular database.

	j. there is a lib file with 2 junit.jar classes, however, it seems that there are no JUnit test coverages in the source files. The few tests that it has is using GUI main classes to test both the AdvancedSearch and SimpleSearch classes, in the Search file and the Schedule file, but other than that I can not find other test cases for the project. However, we are yet to tell if we should have more test cases since we are just able to see a blank page when we start the program. But I do think we should test for major pass times, as in if someone with a specific major will be able to add a class in pass time 1 or 2 or even 3, and test if it gives an error or not.
