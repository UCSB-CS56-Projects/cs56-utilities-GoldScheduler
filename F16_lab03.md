	1. We are creating a bot that will enable the user to input a set of desired classes, which the bot will automatically get for you from the ninjacourse database. This will allow users to take their time while building their schedules.
	2. As a computer engineer at UCSB I can see that the current version of the GOLDER is a bit outdated. It relies on obtaining information from Ninjacourses, which itself is a bit outdated in terms of courses offered at the university, and isn't very user friendly when it comes to simplifying class schedules.( It generates 10's of options that you manually look through each one). Also there are various bugs that cause it to fail that we have to fix as well. 

	3. The software somewhat runs, meaning that there is code that causes teh GUI to start up the application. However, this is ruined by the fact that it just loads up a blank white screen with no login information or anything.

	4.I believe that we can add a couple of features that could make this more usable towards the student population as a whole. The first would be the main task we were assigned, which is to change the data source we obtain the courses availible from, to a UCSB data server and not ninjacourses. Another thing we can do is make this a real bot in that after selecting all your courses it can cycle through desired courses and times to give you the classes you want at your pass time. We can also make this availible to all UCSB students utilizing their ucsbnetID, rather than registering manually through the application itself. 

	5. Information that could be added could be what benefits this code has in terms of functionality when compared to Ninjacourse, the database that this code is currently taking it's data from. The current READMe is a good summary of what the code does, but as stated above it's confusing as to what makes this code unique from Ninjacourses.

	6. Most of the descriptions are just the targetnames, but most of them do give you a general idea what each target is/does; the targetnames are pretty self-explanatory.However, for init and compile they both have the same description as "compile", causing some confusion as to the functionality of both targets. There doesn't really seemt o be old stuff that needs to be removed. 

	7. There are currently 6 current issues for the project. The biggest problem seems to be that the GUI doesn't load up the proper login widgets and any graphics at all. All it loads up is a blank screen. We need to update the scraper tool in order for it to update the outdated GOLD ninjacourse information, or more likely we can add a bit of code so that it can update everytime we load up the program. Another problem is that the code for the web scraper and the socket connections all written in python and not java, so we'll need to rewrite that language. The rest of the issues are just code files that need to be redistrubuted and made easier, and also to clean up some archaic code. Also we need to update the database connection from MySQL to MySQL DB. I believe there are enough issues for us to update and possibly do more with in this project.

	8. I haven't really seen anymore issues mostly due to the fact that the GUI won't let us really test anymore functions due to the blank screen error listed above.
