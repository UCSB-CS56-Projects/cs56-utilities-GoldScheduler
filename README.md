An improved version of the class search/scheduler on Gold

Overview:
  This program uses data from the UCSB course catalog that is taken off the [a link](ninjacourses.com) website. Golder works by scraping data from ninjacourses to insert in our database along with user information, and then displaying the course info on screen for specific users. This program allows students to search for classes and build preview schedules on a blank slate so that they do not need to worry about being swift when their pass time is up. Built with a simplistic, lightweight design, and allowing users to search for classes in a better way than Gold currently offers, our program is designed to make registration less of a pain.
